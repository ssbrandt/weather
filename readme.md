# BuddyMeUp Project

## Overview

This project contains an application developed during the WWCode Python BuddyMeUp program. The initial concept is to develop a weather application, a transit application, and then integrate the two. The outcome may provide users the ability to plan trips and see weather conditions at various destinations. Above all this project is meant as a learning experience for the contributors and as such, the concept is likely to evolve as the project develops.

## Goals
